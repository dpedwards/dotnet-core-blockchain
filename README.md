A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks. The blocks are linked using cryptography and each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, transaction data, and a timestamp. 


## Notable features

- cryptography 
- process of creating blocks
- process of chaining blocks 
- network & mining
- etc.

## Note

- Blockchain is listening on port :43210
  - Fixed blockchain public key for easy testing: 1EDvdbQVNEtEvSsUpwunpjbGoZa3SCnkUu
  - Fixed blockchain private key for easy testing: KwdUArshaG5LjrY5bji5oJMLvWfwfxkdJAHNYXhf8A49AS89Csi3
